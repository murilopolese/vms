# 1D Cellular Automata

This is a simple one dimensional programmable cellular automata.

It should be learnable by pressing/clicking all the buttons.

I'll explain anyway:

1. The three buttons on top *step*, *run* and *reset* the machine.
2. The first row are the rules. They cycle between 3 states (do your homework):
  a. AND
  b. OR
  c. XOR
3. The second row is the output. The next row will always be a mirror of this one.
