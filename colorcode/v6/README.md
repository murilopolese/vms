# Color code v6 (RELEASE)

This is a version that came after my interface experiments on SPLATy code. It misses the game controller coding charm but it generates much more interesting results, faster.

New things:
- Drawing with the mouse is so, much, better.
- Drawing and edit rules during execution
- There are keyboard shortcuts for selecting colors from 0 to 9.
- Against my own will, I am using numbers and symbols. (But I'm a rebel so I'm using `x`, `ç`, `ʘ`, `å` and `ß` as symbols)
- There is a button that reset/clears the screen

It's 16x16 so it's fully compatible with v3 examples.
